English：
Orynt lets you create multi-segment timed routines, such as 5-minute warmup, 20-minute run, 2-minute rest, repeated 3 times.
It also lets you type text, choose color and scroll speed to display full-screen horizontal banners.
You can link a timer routine to a banner — when the timer ends, it automatically switches to the banner.
